## Algorithm Efficiency

Algorithm Efficiency's purpose is to serve as a teaching and visualization tool with two main goals:

- Analyze the differences in efficiency between imperative languages
- Visualize the runtime efficiency of algorythms

This is accomplished with a collection of algorythms written in various languages and a central program that orchestrates their interactions and times their functions
